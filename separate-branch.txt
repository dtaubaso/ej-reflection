Reflect: When to use a separate branch
You just saw that the workflow when making changes in a separate branch is more complicated than working directly in master, especially when you need to stay up-to-date with changes others are making. Rather than simply pulling and pushing, you need to pull changes into your local master branch, merge the local master into your branch (different-oil, in our case), then push your branch to the remote before finally merging your branch into master, either locally or on GitHub.

Given that, please add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next" to put everything you've learned together by contributing to the create-your-own-adventure repository.
